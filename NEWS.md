# isocat 0.3.0
## New function
* New function `makeMultiMonthIsoscape` to combine multiple monthly isoscapes and error maps into one of each, for making month-specific isoscape assignments.

## Tweaks
* `schoenersD` function now automatically normalizes surfaces to sum to 1, rather than just advising it in the documentation.
* corrected documentation parameter names in `.assignmentMaker`


# isocat 0.2.6

## Publication update
* Publication introducing some of isocat's functionalities is out. 
* Package citation is created, update. See `citation("isocat")`.
* Updated package description with links, typo fixes.


## Vignette improvements
* Added some additional text on transfer functions


# isocat 0.2.5

## Rewrote function `isotopeAssignmentModel`
* Function now checks for identical projections and resamples secondary models automatically.
* Multiple secondary models can be incorporated as a rasterStack.
* Replaced parallelization package with parallel::mcmapply.
* Removes bug where secondary models not created when running in parallel.

## Minor tweaks
* Remove now-unnecessary import of package `dplyr`.
* Resolved bug in vignette example by adding 'stringsAsFactors = FALSE' to example dataframe.
* Removed defunct class test for individual IDs from `meanAggregateClusterProbability` function.


## isocat 0.2.4

## Optimize 'cumsumbelow' function
* Function deals with NA values more efficiently.
* When imported into `makeCumSumSurface`, function iterates faster over RasterLayers.
* Removed dependency on `purrr::map` and pipe operators within function.
* The `purrr` package removed from suggested packages.

## Bug fix for R 4.0.0
* Modified conditional class check within `cumsumAtSamplingLocation` and `clusterSimmatrix` functions, in anticipation of change to matrix objects inheriting from class "array" (which broke old class check code).

## Vignette updated
* Vignette updated, examples improved, enable stage-skipping with working examples.

## Minor tweaks
* Tweaked package title.
* Added 'additionalModel_name' argument to `isotopeAssignmentModel`.
* Added 'seealso' and 'alias' components to function documentation.
* Fixed typo in examples for `makeQuantileSimulationSurface` function.
* Clarified function description for `schoenersD` function.
* Tweaked wording in example for `cumsumAtSamplingLocation` function.




# isocat 0.2.3

## Bug fixes
* Updated data file to realistic isoscape standard deviations.
* Fixed dependency / import issues throughout.
* Adjusted file names for cross-platform compatibility.
* Replaced references to superseded `snow` package with calls to `parallel`.

## Vignette updated
* Vignette updated, TODO's resolved.

## Minor Tweaks
* Expanded DESCRIPTION metadata.
* Resolved spelling errors and improved style throughout package.
* Fixed broken/suspect email and IsoMAP links.
* Corrected donttest wrappers on long analyses.
* Added examples to several functions.
* Switched from 'installed.packages' to '!requireNamespace' to check for package loading.


# isocat 0.2.2

## Vignette Included
* Added vignette with descriptions and example applications of all functions.

## New Functions
* New suite of functions for working with cumulative sums: `cumsumbelow`, `makeCumSumSurface`, `cumsumAtSamplingLocation`.
* Added a `meanAggregateClusterProbability` function to create mean probability-of-origin map based on cluster assignments (for individuals of similar origin).
* Added `projectSummarySurface` function to show which RasterLayer in a stack has highest value at any given location.

## Bug fixes
* Fixed minor issue with running `makeQuantileSimulationSurface` on object of class RasterLayer.
* Updated `clusterSimmatrix` function to match `pvclust` version 2.0-1 with debug of `r` parameter.
* Replaced buggy `projectCluster` function with alternative function (`projectSummarySurface`; see `isocat` vignette).


# isocat 0.2.1

## New Functions
* Added a `schoenersD` function that compares the spatial similarity of two surfaces.
* Added a `makeQuantileSimulationSurface` function that converts a surface to a quantile-simulation surface.

## Minor Tweaks
* Improved code readability within several functions.


# isocat 0.2.0

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Renamed package from `IsoModAT` (Isotope Models of Animal Origin Analytical Toolset) to `isocat` (Isotope Clustering and Assignment Tools). 
* Specified CC0 license.

## New Functions
* Added a `makeQuantileSurface` function to converts normalized probability surfaces to quantile surface. Matches `makeOddsSurface`.
* Added a `oddsAtSamplingLocation` function that finds odds ratios of origin probability at a set of coordinates within a normalized probability surface. Matches `quantileAtSamplingLocation`.
